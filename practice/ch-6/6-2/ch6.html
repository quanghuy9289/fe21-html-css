          <p>What's 75 million years old and
            brand spanking new? A teenage
            Utahceratops! Come to the
            Saroyan, armed with your best
            dinosaur roar, when Scott
            Sampson, Research Curator at
            the Utah Museum of Natural
            History, steps to the podium.
            Sampson's research has focused
            on the ecology and evolution of
            lat e Cretaceous dinosaurs and
            he has conducted fieldwork in a
            number of countries in Africa.

          <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadianborn
            paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
            University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species
            of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of
            Montana, as well as the gro and function of certopsid horns and
            fril ls.

            Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
            American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by
            five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College
            of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University
            of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
            Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
            paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
            interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
            morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
