        <h3>February <br />Scott Sampson</h3>
        <p>What's 75 million years old and
          brand spanking new? A teenage
          Utahceratops! Come to the
          Saroyan, armed with your best
          dinosaur roar, when Scott
          Sampson, Research Curator at
          the Utah Museum of Natural
          History, steps to the podium.
          Sampson's research has focused
          on the ecology and evolution of
          lat e Cretaceous dinosaurs and
          he has conducted fieldwork in a
          number of countries in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadianborn
          paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
          University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species
          of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of
          Montana, as well as the gro and function of certopsid horns and
          fril ls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
          American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by
          five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College
          of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University
          of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
          Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
          paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
          interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
          morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson
          has conducted paleontological work in Zimbabv,,e, South Africa, and
          Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also
          the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and
          recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in
          the Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of
          dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
