                <p>
                  Town Hall has the answer. For only $100, you can get a book of tickets for all of the remaining speakers. And
                  the bargain includes a second book of tickets for a companion.

                  Or, for $50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers, and still get an extra ticket for a companion, but
                  for just one of the events.
