				<h3>Scott Sampson </h3>
				<p>What's 75 million years old and

					Utahceratops! Come to the 
					Saroyan, armed with your best 
					dinosaur roar, when Scott 
					Sampson, Research Curator at the 
					Utah Museum of Natural History, 
					steps to the podium. Sampson's 
					research has focused on the 
					ecology and evolution of late 
					Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has

                Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.
                <pre></pre>
                Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
                <pre class="last"></pre>
                In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological 
                work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was 
                also the on-the-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a 
                book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most 
                comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
