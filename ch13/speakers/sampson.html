          What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
          Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar,
          when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural
          History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the
          ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
          conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa. 
        <p>Scott Sampson
            is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology
            from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new
            species of ceratopsids, or horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous
            of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid horns and
            frills.</p> 
        <p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at
                the American Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed by
                five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College
                of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University
                of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
                Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
                paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
                interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
                morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p> 
                <p>In addition to
                    his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted
                    paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as
                    well as the United States and Canada. He was also the on-the-air host
                    for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a
                    book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is
                    one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to
                    date.</p>
